# Cookey
A simple script for cookie cloker, that creates Keyboard Shotcuts

## Keybinds

###Buying
All calculations are based on current CPS. Golden cookies and Clicks throw the timing off. When a frenzy starts the timer should be restarted
####T: Auto buy (the main feature of this script)
It calculates the time until you can buy a building and buys it when it becomes available
####N: Next
tells you which building is next and when you can buy it
####B: Buy
Buys the next building if you are able to. Tells you when you can't buy if you're unable. 
####V: Very Impatient Buying
Buy the best building you can afford at the moment (Put in at request from someone very impatient)

### Wrinklers
####P: Pop 
Pops the wrinkler with the most cookies in it. Does nothing when there are no wrinklers.
####W: Wrinklers
shows you the amount of cookies you get when you pop all wrinklers

###Golden Cookies
####O: Optimum
Outputs the maximum amount of cookies you can get from lucky (Outdated)
####S: Safety mode
Enables safety mode, which makes the script optimise for active playing.
It makes the script not buy anything if that puts you under the optimum Lucky Bank amount.
